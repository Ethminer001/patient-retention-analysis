# 🏥 Patient Retention Analysis

## 🎯 Business Problem

A multi-specialty medical clinic network is experiencing a **30% patient no-show rate**, creating significant challenges:

**Health Impact:**
- Patients miss critical follow-up care
- Chronic conditions worsen without monitoring
- Preventable health complications increase

**Financial Impact:**
- $2.1M in lost annual revenue
- Wasted clinical resources and staff time
- Reduced operational efficiency

**Quality Metrics:**
- Lower patient satisfaction scores
- Compliance issues with care continuity standards
- Negative impact on health outcomes

**Executive Question:**  
"Why are patients not returning for appointments, and what interventions will improve retention?"

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle Medical Appointment No-Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)  
**Period:** April 2016 – June 2016  
**Records:** 110,527 appointments  
**Unique Patients:** 62,299  

**Key Variables:**
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, neighborhood  
- **Medical Factors:** Hypertension, diabetes, alcoholism, disability  
- **Behavioral Data:** SMS reminder status, previous no-show history  
- **Appointment Details:** Scheduled date, appointment date, booking advance time  
- **Outcome:** Showed up or no-show

---

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**  
   Validated 110K+ records, converted dates, created time-based features, engineered risk indicators  
   **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL (SQLite)

2. **SQL Analysis**  
   30+ queries across 4 domains: retention patterns, risk factors, geographic analysis, operational patterns

3. **Statistical Analysis & Segmentation**  
   Patient-level risk scoring, cohort analysis, correlation of predictors  
   **Tools:** Python (Pandas, SciPy)

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   Stacking ensemble of Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost  
   Test ROC-AUC: 0.84 (0.8421)  
   **Tools:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

5. **Intervention Analysis**  
   ROI calculation, cost-benefit analysis, implementation roadmap  
   **Tools:** Python (custom calculations)

## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

![Age Distribution](visuals/age_distribution.png)  
*Shows most patients are between 20–40 years old, the prime working-age group.*

![No-show by Age Group](visuals/no_show_by_age_group.png)  
*Younger patients (<30) have higher no-show rates compared to older patients.*

![No-show by SMS Reminder](visuals/no_show_by_sms.png)  
*Patients receiving SMS reminders are far less likely to miss appointments.*

![No-show by Booking Advance](visuals/no_show_by_booking_advance.png)  
*No-shows increase sharply when appointments are booked more than 30 days in advance.*

![Exploration Charts](visuals/exploration_charts.png)  
*Combined dashboard of demographic and behavioral patterns.*

## 🤖 Modeling & Feature Insights

![Model Comparison](visuals/model_comparison.png)  
*Stacking model achieved the highest AUC score, outperforming Logistic Regression and Random Forest.*

![Feature Importance](visuals/feature_importance.png)  
*Waiting days and SMS reminders are the strongest predictors of patient attendance.*

![Feature Importance (Gradient Boosting)](visuals/feature_importance_gb.png)  
*Gradient Boosting highlights behavioral factors as key drivers of no-shows.*

![Feature Importance (XGBoost)](visuals/feature_importance_xgb.png)  
*XGBoost confirms SMS reminders and booking advance time as critical features.*

![Risk Heatmap](visuals/risk_heatmap.png)  
*No-show risk rises with longer waiting days, especially without SMS reminders.*

![Patient Segmentation](visuals/patient_segmentation.png)  
*Risk categories show most patients are low risk, but a small high-risk group drives many no-shows.*

![Patient Segmentation (Bar)](visuals/patient_segmentation_bar.png)  
*Bar chart view of patient distribution across risk categories.*

## 💰 Intervention ROI & Operational Patterns

![Intervention ROI](visuals/intervention_roi.png)  
*SMS reminders deliver the highest ROI, followed by scheduling optimization and high-risk outreach.*

![Temporal Patterns](visuals/temporal_patterns.png)  
*Appointments peak midweek, with Friday having the highest attendance and weekends the lowest.*

## 💰 Total Business Impact

**Year 1 Projection:**
- **Revenue Recovery:** $2,374,000  
- **Implementation Costs:** $105,540  
- **Net Benefit:** $2,268,460  
- **ROI:** 2,149%  
- **No-shows prevented:** ~13,000+

---

## ⚠️ Limitations and Future Work

- Data limited to April–June 2016  
- Revenue recovery and ROI figures are projections from stated assumptions, not measured results  
- No direct health outcome linkage  
- Neighborhood-level geography only  
- No appointment type differentiation  

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integrate EHR/claims data  
- Real-time dashboard & automated outreach  
- A/B test reminder timing & content  
- Explore deep learning & time-series forecasting
